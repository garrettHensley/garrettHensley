# ✨ Welcome to my GitHub ✨

Hi! My name is Garrett. I'm a Full Stack Engineer in the Healthcare Sector.

My passions include technology, eSports, mountain biking, and  coffee. I consider myself self-motivated, fast-learning, highly energetic, and adaptable, which I believe makes me compatible with nearly any group of people.

Over the past few years, I’ve created eSports organizations, where I developed and maintained websites, lead groups of people, connected with game developers and broadcasting talent. With these organizations I engaged a high amount of users and maintained a strong presence across social media platforms.

My philosophy for personal projects is to create something for my friends & family. With that in mind, one day I would like to launch a project that everyone in my close circle can use.

In my free time I am building an app for my Dungeons & Dragons group.
